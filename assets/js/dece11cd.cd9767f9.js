Organizations that invest time in establishing strong governance frameworks from the start find themselves better positioned to scale, adapt, and maintain security as they grow. Think of it as building a house: without a solid foundation, any additions or modifications become increasingly risky and complex. Cloud governance controls, including Service Control Policies (SCPs), guardrails, and compliance frameworks, act as the architectural blueprints and building codes that ensure your cloud infrastructure remains secure, compliant, and manageable. When expanding into new regions, having these controls in place makes the extension process more streamlined and secure.

In contrast, AWS Control Tower offers a more streamlined, automated approach through Account Factory alongside pre-built governance controls and standardized guardrails.

It's like having your security team already stationed at the new location before you arrive. Your existing IAM principals will automatically have the same permissions as they do in other regions (assuming your policies don't include region-specific restrictions).
