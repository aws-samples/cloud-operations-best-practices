Applications are essential for customer businesses. They are groups of resources that work together to provide specific features or services that the end user needs. In today\'s fast evolving digital landscape, organizing your AWS resources into well-defined applications has become crucial for efficient Cloud Operations. This application-centric approach is needed to solve common challenges such as resource spread, operational inefficiencies, and the complexity of managing resources across multiple AWS accounts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/application-operations/tagging/index":{"id":"guides/application-operations/tagging/index","title":"Tagging Services comparison","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/AWS CloudTrail/CloudTrail Lake/CloudTrail Lake Event Enrichment/index":{"id":"guides/AWS CloudTrail/CloudTrail Lake/CloudTrail Lake Event Enrichment/index","title":"Best Practices for CloudTrail Lake event enrichment","description":"CloudTrail event enrichment allows you to enhance management and data events by adding resource tag keys, and IAM global condition keys, including principal tag keys,  when creating or updating an event data store. This enrichment enables better categorization, searching, and analysis of CloudTrail events based on business context, such as cost allocation, financial management, operations, and data security requirements. The enriched events include an eventContext field that provides contextual information for API actions, which you can analyze by running queries in CloudTrail Lake or through federation with Amazon Athena. This feature helps organizations better understand and track their AWS resource usage and security posture by incorporating additional metadata about resources, principals, and authorization conditions into their event logs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/AWS CloudTrail/CloudTrail Lake/index":{"id":"guides/AWS CloudTrail/CloudTrail Lake/index","title":"CloudTrail Lake","description":"CloudTrail Lake aggregates, immutably stores, and queries ingested events, offering a managed data lake for your organization.
