Start with a pilot implementation in a non-production environment to validate your selection logic and measure the impact on event volume and costs. Gradually expand the implementation while monitoring the effectiveness of your selection strategy. This approach allows you to identify and address issues before they impact your production logging capabilities and provides opportunities to refine your selectors based on real-world usage patterns."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"monitoring-and-validation",children:"Monitoring and Validation"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Establish comprehensive monitoring for your CloudTrail advanced event selectors to ensure they continue to meet your security and compliance requirements over time.

For example, use naming conventions in your resource ARNs to automatically apply appropriate logging levels based on environment, sensitivity, or business unit. Pattern-based selection is particularly effective for organizations with consistent naming standards and can significantly reduce the complexity of managing event selectors across large AWS environments. This approach also provides automatic coverage for new resources that follow established naming patterns."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"multi-condition-logic-implementation",children:"Multi-Condition Logic Implementation"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Advanced event selectors support complex logical conditions that can be used to create sophisticated selection rules. Combine multiple field selectors within a single advanced event selector to create AND conditions, or use multiple advanced event selectors to create OR conditions. For example, you might create a selector that captures all write operations on sensitive resources OR any operations performed by privileged users. Understanding how to effectively combine conditions allows you to create precise selection rules that capture exactly the events you need while excluding everything else."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var t=i(6540);const s={},a=t.createContext(s);function o(e){const n=t.useContext(a);return t.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function r(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),t.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
