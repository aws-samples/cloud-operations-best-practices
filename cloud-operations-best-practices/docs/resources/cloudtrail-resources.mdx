## AWS CloudTrail Workshops

These hands-on workshops simulate common security events and demonstrate detection and response using AWS CloudTrail and related services. Each workshop includes a CloudFormation template or script to replicate real-world scenarios.

### Workshop List
- **[Unauthorized IAM Credential Use](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/6a8ad836-10a6-4694-9a3b-f53f193041de/en-US/setup/cloudformation)**  
  **Description**: Simulate unauthorized IAM credential use via a CloudShell script, mimicking reconnaissance and privilege escalation.  
  **Why It Matters**: Learn to detect and mitigate unauthorized access, a common attack vector in AWS environments.

- **[Ransomware on S3](https://catalog.workshops.aws/aws-cirt-ransomware-simulation-and-detection/en-US)**  
  **Description**: Use a CloudFormation template to create S3 buckets and simulate ransomware via data exfiltration and deletion in CloudShell.  
  **Why It Matters**: Protect against data loss or exposure by detecting unauthorized S3 modifications.

- **[Cryptominer Security Events](https://catalog.workshops.aws/aws-cirt-cryptominer-simulation-and-detection/en-US)**  
  **Description**: Deploy EC2 instances via CloudFormation to simulate cryptomining through DNS requests to known domains.  
  **Why It Matters**: Identify resource-intensive cryptomining to reduce costs and secure EC2 instances.

- **[SSRF on IMDSv1](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/6a8ad836-10a6-4694-9a3b-f53f193041de/en-US/setup/ssrf)**  
  **Description**: Simulate a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on EC2 instance credentials via IMDSv1 vulnerabilities.
