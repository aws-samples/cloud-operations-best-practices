# Centralized patch compliance reporting

## What is patch compliance?

Patch compliance is the process of ensuring all computing resources have the latest security updates and bug fixes installed according to organizational policies. A system is considered "patch compliant" when all required patches defined in your patch baseline have been successfully applied. Non-compliant systems may have missing critical security updates, potentially exposing your organization to security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

In modern cloud environments spanning multiple AWS accounts and regions, decentralized patch management creates significant challenges including visibility gaps, inconsistent reporting, delayed responses to vulnerabilities, complex audit processes, and duplicated effort across teams. These challenges can lead to extended security exposure and inefficient use of resources throughout your organization.

Centralized patch compliance reporting addresses these challenges by consolidating data from all accounts and regions into a single location, providing a comprehensive view of your security posture. This approach delivers numerous benefits: a single source of truth for compliance status, real-time awareness of vulnerabilities, consistent metrics across environments, simplified auditing, trend analysis capabilities, improved resource efficiency, and the foundation for automated remediation workflows.

AWS Systems Manager provides the foundation for this centralization through Patch Manager to automate patching processes, [resource data syncs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/inventory-create-resource-data-sync.html) to aggregate compliance data into a central S3 bucket, and analytics services like AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon QuickSight to transform, query, and visualize the data. The solution described in this recipe leverages these components to create a comprehensive reporting system that works across your entire AWS organization, enabling more efficient operations and faster vulnerability remediation.

:::tip
The resource data sync provides inventory and patch compliance metadata in the form of a JSON file. As an alternative to using Athena and QuickSight, you can use any BI or analytics tool that can pull the data from the S3 bucket.
:::

## Purpose

The purpose of this recipe is to provide sample CloudFormation templates which can be used to provision the resources required for centralized patch compliance reporting. This recipe does not cover deploying patch scan or install operations.

For more information on how to prepare for patching managed nodes, see [Patching managed nodes using AWS Systems Manager and tagging](/cloud-operations-best-practices/docs/solutions/centralized-operations-management/patch-nodes-using-tags/).

## Prerequisites

Before beginning deployment, ensure you have:

* AWS Organizations setup: A properly configured AWS Organization with a management account and member accounts.
* Managed nodes configured: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, AWS Internet of Things (IoT) Greengrass core devices, on-premises servers, edge devices, and VMs must be Systems Manager managed nodes to perform patching operations and report patch compliance.
* Patch operations implemented: At minimum, a patch scan operation must be configured and executed at least once. Without this, there will be no compliance data to report on. For more information on different types of patching and how to implement patching, see the [Patch Management Best Practices guide](/cloud-operations-best-practices/docs/guides/centralized-operations-management/patch-management) and the section [Different types of patching](/cloud-operations-best-practices/docs/guides/centralized-operations-management/patch-management#different-types-of-patching).
* IAM permissions: Appropriate permissions to deploy CloudFormation templates and create the required resources in both the central reporting account and member accounts.
* Amazon QuickSight: In order to visualize patch compliance information using QuickSight, you must [sign up for QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/signing-up.html).
* Amazon QuickSight Permissions to S3: You must ensure QuickSight has permissions to the S3 buckets created in [Phase 1: Central account setup](#phase-1-central-account-setup). More information is provided in [Prerequisites to complete before deploying the CloudFormation template for QuickSight](#prerequisites-to-complete-before-deploying-the-cloudformation-template-for-quicksight).

## Considerations

### Resource data sync

Currently, the `AWS::SSM::ResourceDataSync` resource in AWS CloudFormation does not support the `DestinationDataSharing` property within the [S3Destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ssm-resourcedatasync-s3destination.html) property which is required to create an inventory resource data sync which supports a simplified S3 bucket policy.

Due to this, this recipe uses a custom CloudFormation resource in the [Sample CloudFormation template for organization resource data sync](#sample-cloudformation-template-for-organization-resource-data-sync) section to use a Lambda function to create the resource data sync.

Alternatives to using the custom resource to create the resource data sync:

1. Use the standard resource data sync which is supported by CloudFormation.
    1. To accomplish this, you must create and use a bucket policy which grants permissions based in AWS account IDs. For more information and an example S3 bucket policy, see [Before you begin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/inventory-create-resource-data-sync.html#datasync-before-you-begin).
    1. Update the S3 bucket policy in the [Sample CloudFormation template for central reporting using Athena](#sample-cloudformation-template-for-central-reporting-using-athena) to use the new policy which lists out the AWS account IDs.
    1. Use CloudFormation StackSets to deploy the `AWS::SSM::ResourceDataSync` resource. For an example CloudFormation resource snippet, see [Create a SyncToDestination resource data sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ssm-resourcedatasync.html#aws-resource-ssm-resourcedatasync--examples--Create_a_SyncToDestination_resource_data_sync).
1. Use an alternative method to create the organization resource data sync, for example, scripting via the AWS CLI or other SDKs.

### Cost considerations

Implementing centralized patch compliance reporting involves several AWS services, each with associated costs:

1. [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/):
    * Standard storage costs for inventory and patch compliance data
    * Data transfer costs for syncing data from multiple accounts and regions
      * Cost increases linearly with the number of managed nodes and scan frequency
1. [AWS Glue pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/):
    * Crawler costs
    * For the default configuration (daily crawler run)
1. [Amazon Athena pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/):
    * Query costs
    * Cost varies based on query complexity and frequency
    * Using partitioning and filtering can significantly reduce costs
1. [AWS Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/):
    * Minimal costs for the custom resource Lambda function
    * Free tier typically covers this usage for most implementations
1. [Amazon QuickSight pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/) (optional):
    * Author licenses and Reader licenses

## Architecture overview

### Central reporting account

In the following diagram, the **Central Reporting** account is an AWS account within your AWS Organization dedicated for storing the patch and inventory metadata and querying or visualization.

:::warning
It is **not recommended** to use the [AWS Organization management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/userguide/management-account.html) as the **Central reporting account**. [AWS best practices for the management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_best-practices_mgmt-acct.html#bp_mgmt-acct_use-mgmt) recommends that you use the management account and its users and roles for tasks that **must** be performed only by that account. Store all of your AWS resources in other AWS accounts in the organization and keep them out of the management account.
:::

![Architecture for the central reporting account](/img/recipes/central-reporting/architecture-diagram-reporting-account.png "Architecture for the central reporting account")

1. The Glue crawler runs once a day to crawl the S3 bucket which hosts the resource data sync provided metadata.
1. The Glue crawler updates the database and tables based on the metadata in the S3 bucket.
1. After the Glue crawler completes its run, an event is sent to EventBridge.
1. An EventBridge rule invokes the Lambda function.
1. The Lambda function removes a duplicative column for the AWS:InstanceInformation table.
    :::info
    The `AWS:InstanceInformation` table includes a column named `resourcetype`, which is also a partition key, which causes Athena queries to fail. The EventBridge rule is triggered by the Glue crawler execution, which then invokes the Lambda function to delete the column.
    :::
1. Athena queries the Glue database and tables based on the queries you run.
1. (Optionally) You can create a QuickSight dashboard to visualize patch compliance information. **Note:** QuickSight is not included in the example CloudFormation template.

### Member account(s)/Region(s) with managed nodes

![Architecture for the AWS Organization resource data sync](/img/recipes/central-reporting/architecture-diagram-ssm-org-resource-data-sync.png "Architecture for the AWS Organization resource data sync")

1. The CloudFormation StackSet in the delegated administrator account creates stack instances in the target AWS accounts/Regions to create the required resources.
1. The stack instance creates an IAM service role, Lambda function, and custom CloudFormation resource.
1. The Lambda function creates a Systems Manager resource data sync for AWS Organizations.
1. The resource data sync sends inventory and patch compliance metadata to the S3 bucket specified in the [central reporting account](#central-reporting-account).

### Process timeline

The following diagram displays the process timeline of querying patch compliance for managed nodes.

![Process timeline for patching operations](/img/recipes/central-reporting/architecture-diagram-org-patch-reporting-combined.png "Process timeline for patching operations")

1. Following a patch scan, install, or inventory metadata gathering operation, SSM agent on the managed node reports back data to Systems Manager.
1. The patch and inventory metadata updates are identified by the resource data sync based on actions taken.
1. The resource data sync ships the metadata to the S3 bucket specified in the central reporting account.
1. You can then use Athena to query the results following the operation.

As noted in the diagram above, you can register hybrid managed nodes for patching or inventory metadata gathering and the data will flow into the same S3 bucket as EC2 instances.

1. In the central reporting account and Region, navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
1. In left navigation pane, choose **Stacks**, and then choose **Create stack**.
1. From the dropdown list, choose **With new resources (standard)**.
1. On the **Create stack** page, select **Upload a template file**, select **Choose file**, choose the `patch-reporting.yaml` file, and then choose **Next**.
1. On the **Specify stack details** page, perform the following steps:
    1. For **Stack name**, enter a descriptive name, such as `patch-reporting`.
    1. For **Organization ID**, enter the AWS Organization ID for your AWS Organization. For example, `o-abcde12345`.
    :::tip
    For more information on how to retrieve the AWS Organization ID, see [Viewing details of an organization from the management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html).
    :::
    1. For **Enable Glue Crawler Schedule**, choose to enable or disbale scheduled execution of the Glue crawler.
    1. For **Glue Crawler Schedule (cron)**, enter a cron schedule expression for the Glue crawler.

    1. For **Name of the resource data sync S3 bucket**, enter the name of the S3 bucket you created in the previous section.
    :::tip
    In the central reporting account, you can find the S3 bucket name in the **Outputs** of the CloudFormation stack provisioned.
    ![Outputs of the CloudFormation stack to show the resource data sync S3 bucket name](/img/recipes/central-reporting/patch-reporting-cfn-outputs.png "Outputs of the CloudFormation stack to show the resource data sync S3 bucket name")
    :::
    1. For **Prefix for the resource data sync S3 bucket**, enter a name for the prefix used for the S3 bucket, such as `ResourceDataSync`.
    1. For **AWS Region for the resource data sync S3 bucket**, enter the Region for the resource data sync S3 bucket.
    1. For **Name of the resource data sync**, enter the name for the resource data sync.
    1. Choose **Next**.
1. On the **Configure StackSet options** page, add any required tags, select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**, and then choose **Next**.
1. On the **Set deployment options** page, perform the following steps:
    1. For **Deployment targets**, choose to deploy to the organization or to specific organization units (OUs).
    :::tip
    It is recommended to deploy resource data syncs to all accounts and Regions where you have nodes managed by AWS Systems Manager to ensure all available inventory and patch metadata is aggregated into a single S3 bucket for querying, reporting, and visualization.
    :::
    1. For **Specify Regions**, select the Regions where you want to deploy the resource data sync.
    1. Leave all other options as their defaults and choose **Next**.
1. On the **Review** page, review all the information, and then choose **Submit** to create your StackSet.

After the page is refreshed, you will be able to see your StackSet. The status will change to `SUCCEEDED` after it’s been created.

## Phase 3: Verification and Testing

### Verify metadata in resource data sync S3 bucket

In the central reporting account, navigate to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) and select the S3 bucket created by CloudFormation named similarly to `ssm-resource-sync-${region}-${account-id}`. In the S3 bucket, select the bucket prefix you provided when [deploying the CloudFormation StackSet](#deploy-a-cloudformation-stackset).

In the bucket, you can see the various data types that are synchronized by the resource data sync automatically. If you have previously configured Inventory metadata gathering and performed at least a patch scan operation, you should see additional folders (e.g. `AWS:Application`, `AWS:AWSComponent`) in the S3 bucket. Each folder represents [metadata collected by Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/inventory-schema.html).

![S3 bucket folders for resource data sync metadata](/img/recipes/central-reporting/s3-bucket-objects.png "S3 bucket folders for resource data sync metadata")

Within each of the data type prefixes, there will be a prefix for each account that is using resource data sync with this S3 bucket. This is followed by a prefix for each Region that is reporting inventory, and then a prefix for the resource type, which will generally be `ManagedInstanceInventory`. Then within that prefix, there will be a JSON file for each instance that reports Inventory data.

### Verify access to QuickSight analysis

Verify you have access to the QuickSight Analysis dashboard created by CloudFormation by navigating to the [QuickSight console](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/start/analyses).

If you do not see the analysis named **Managed Node Analysis CFN**, ensure you are logged into QuickSight as the same user you specified in the CloudFormation parameter `QuickSightUser`. You can verify the user you are logged into QuickSight with by selecting your profile in the upper-right corner.

![QuickSight analysis created by CloudFormation](/img/recipes/central-reporting/quicksight-analysis.png "QuickSight analysis created by CloudFormation")

## Query patch compliance

### Review the Glue crawler

Now that resource data sync has synchronized Systems Manager data to the S3 bucket, we can use a Glue crawler to create tables from the JSON files. The Glue crawler is configured to run once a day at 00:00 UTC. You can either wait for the Glue crawler to run or you can manually run the crawler and generate tables to query in Athena.

1. Open the [AWS Glue console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home/v2/home) and in the navigation pane, choose **Crawlers** under the **Data Catalog** header.
1. Select the **SSM-GlueCrawler** and choose **Run**.

The Crawler should run for approximately 2-4 minutes before stopping. Once the Crawler has returned to the Ready state, verify that tables were added to the resulting database by choosing **Tables** in the navigation pane.

### Query using Athena

1. Log in to the [central reporting AWS account](#central-reporting-account) where you deployed the KMS, S3, Glue, and Athena resources.
1. Open the [Amazon Athena console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home) and in the navigation pane, choose **Query editor**.
1. In the upper-right corner, for **Workgroup**, choose **patch-workgroup**.
1. For **Workgroup patch-workgroup settings**, choose **Acknowledge**.
1. Choose the **Saved queries** tab to see the sample queries.
1. Select a saved query, such as **QueryNonCompliantPatch**, and choose **Run**.
1. Validate query results are returned for managed nodes that are missing updates and are non-compliant.

![Athena query results for QueryNonCompliantPatch](/img/recipes/central-reporting/athena-query-results.png "Athena query results for QueryNonCompliantPatch")

:::warning
In order to use the **Saved queries** named **QuerySSMAgentVersion** and **QueryInstanceApplications**, you must enable [Systems Manager Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-inventory.html). You can quickly enable Systems Manager Inventory when onboarding to the [Systems Manager unified console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up-organizations.html).
:::

### Additional Athena sample queries

#### Group updates for non-compliant managed nodes

The following example Athena query groups non-compliant updates by managed node.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="query"
    values={[
        {label: 'Query', value: 'query'},
        {label: 'Results', value: 'results'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="query">

```sql
-- Query to aggregate non-compliant patch compliance items by resource (limited to 20 results)
SELECT 
    ci.resourceid,
    ci.status,
    ci.patchstate,
    LISTAGG(DISTINCT ci.id, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ci.id) AS ids
FROM 
    aws_complianceitem ci
WHERE 
    ci.compliancetype = 'Patch'
    AND ci.status = 'NON_COMPLIANT'
GROUP BY 
    ci.resourceid,
    ci.status,
    ci.patchstate
ORDER BY 
    ci.resourceid
LIMIT 20;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="results">

![Example query results when grouping updates per managed node](/img/recipes/central-reporting/group-updates-per-node.png "Example query results when grouping updates per managed node")

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Filter out non-active managed nodes

Resource data syncs send inventory and patch compliance metadata to S3 buckets. When a managed EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, the `AWS:InstanceInformation` metadata is updated to reflect the new state. For hybrid managed nodes, this status is updated based on the connectivity state of SSM agent. These values are indicated in the `InstanceStatus` key which can have the following values:

* `Active` - SSM agent (on the EC2 or hybrid managed node) is actively running and communicating with AWS Systems Manager.
* `Stopped` - The EC2 instance is in a `Stopped` state.
* `Terminated` - The EC2 instance has been terminated (deleted).
* `ConnectionLost` - SSM agent on the hybrid managed node is not able to communicate with AWS Systems Manager.

:::tip
Resource data syncs do not remove JSON files from the specified S3 bucket. To automatically clean-up managed node metadata JSON files for terminated EC2 instances or deregistered hybrid managed nodes, you can use [S3 lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) to automatically delete objects. For example, you may implement a S3 bucket policy that expires stale objects that have not been updated for 60 days. The sample CloudFormation template in the section, [Sample CloudFormation template for organization resource data sync](#sample-cloudformation-template-for-organization-resource-data-sync), includes a commented-out `LifecycleConfiguration` starting at line 154.
:::

You can use `InstanceStatus` to filter out stopped or terminated instances or hybrid managed nodes in a connection lost state in your Athena queries. For example, the following query returns `AWS:InstanceInformation` metadata for only `Active` managed nodes.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="query"
    values={[
        {label: 'Query', value: 'query'},
        {label: 'Results', value: 'results'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="query">

```sql
-- Query to return only Active managed nodes
SELECT 
    ii.accountid,
    ii.region,
    ii.resourceid,
    ii.computername,
    ii.ipaddress,
    ii.instancestatus,
    ii.platformtype,
    ii.platformname,
    ii.platformversion,

## Visualize patch compliance using QuickSight

The CloudFormation stack deployed in [Deploy a CloudFormation stack for QuickSight in the central reporting account](#deploy-a-cloudformation-stack-for-quicksight-in-the-central-reporting-account), created QuickSight datasets and an empty analysis dashboard so you can begin visualizing patch compliance and inventory metadata.

To create QuickSight visuals, follow the procedures in the two topics listed below:

1. [Part 1: Create QuickSight visuals based on metadata for managed nodes](https://catalog.workshops.aws/getting-started-with-com/en-US/advanced-workshops/organization-patch-reporting/create-quicksight-visuals-and-dashboard)
1. [Part 2: Create AWS QuickSight Visuals for information on Patch Compliance](https://catalog.workshops.aws/getting-started-with-com/en-US/advanced-workshops/organization-patch-reporting/create-quicksight-visuals-for-patch-compliance)

By following the two topics above, you can create a QuickSight dashboard with two sheets that look similar to this:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="instanceinfo"
    values={[
        {label: 'Instance information', value: 'instanceinfo'},
        {label: 'Patch compliance', value: 'patchcompliance'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="instanceinfo">

## Clean-up deployed resources

:::warning
The sample CloudFormation templates in this recipe delete the contents of the S3 buckets upon deleting the CloudFormation stack for the central reporting account.
:::

To clean-up the sample resources created in [Phase 2: Member account configuration](#phase-2-member-account-configuration), you must first [delete the stack instances in your StackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stackinstances-delete.html) and then [delete the StackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-delete.html).

To clean-up the sample resources created in [Phase 1: Central account setup](#phase-1-central-account-setup), perform the following steps:

1. Delete the resources in the stack, `quicksight`, deployed in the section [Deploy a CloudFormation stack for QuickSight in the central reporting account](#deploy-a-cloudformation-stack-for-athena-in-the-central-reporting-account).
1. Delete the resources in the stack, `patch-reporting`, deployed in the section [Deploy a CloudFormation stack for Athena in the central reporting account](#deploy-a-cloudformation-stack-for-athena-in-the-central-reporting-account).

For information on how to delete CloudFormation stacks, see [Delete a stack from the CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html).
