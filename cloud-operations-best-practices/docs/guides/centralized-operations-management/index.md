# Centralized Operations Management

**What is Centralized Operations Management?** 

AWS offers a centralized operations management solution that you can use to manage and operate your applications on AWS, on-premises, in hybrid environments, and at the edge. Operate your applications from a central location with automation, integrations, built-in best practices, and hybrid capabilities. If you are looking to enhance your IT Service Management (ITSM) tools to improve efficiency and consistency, you can use AWS to automate your current integrations and investments while using an all-in-one-tool for operations.

Customers use AWS Systems Manager to manage and operate their resources at scale for on-premises, hybrid, and AWS.  Systems Manager facilitates operational tasks on nodes (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances, nodes on other clouds, and on-premises nodes) such as patching with security-related updates, connecting to nodes without managing SSH keys or maintaining bastion hosts, and automating operational commands at scale. In AWS, a node is considered managed when it has a fully functioning SSM Agent working on-premises, hybrid, and AWS. 

The core functionality of AWS Systems Manager is focused on use cases. The agent being the main component to leveraging AWS Systems Manager features. Once a node is managed by AWS Systems Manager,  youâ€™re able to unlock other features like Remote Management, Patch Management, and Session Management while automating operational tasks.
